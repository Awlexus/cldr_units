# To Do list for Cldr Units

[ ] Support any unit in `Cldr.Unit.display_name/1`

[ ] Confirm numeric prefix units math

[X] Support multiple `per` clauses. After the first one, each per is just a multiplication (not a `per`) since multiplication binds with a higher priority than division.

[X] Fix math on compound currency units
