* Implement SI prefixes in conversions (and unit creation)
* Implement conversion to preferred units in a locale (ie convert KG to LB if in the US locale).  There is supporting data in CLDR preferred units and it seems more coming. Also has different use cases (ie a persons height in feet but other lengths in metres) See https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-info.html#Preferred_Units_For_Usage
